/*
problem: You are making a program to store TVs with their width and height.
The given program declares a TV class with height and width members, an area() method, as well as a constructor that initializes the members of the class.
Complete the program by taking 2 integers as input, create a TV object by passing them to the constructor, and call the area() method.
