problem: Along with other physical health requirements, astronaut candidates must have perfect vision (100%) and their height must be between 62 and 75 inches. Write a program that accordingly takes the vision percentage and height (in inches) as an input and prints "passed" if given conditions are satisfied and "failed" if otherwise.
